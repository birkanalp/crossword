# Orchestrator-Only Execution Policy

- For every user prompt, first read and follow `@.cursor/agents/master-orchestrator-agent.md`.
- Do not implement features directly.
- Do not write or edit application code directly.
- Do not run direct code-edit operations (`ApplyPatch`, direct file writes) except orchestrator metadata/routing docs if absolutely needed.

## Required Behavior

1. Decompose the request into atomic tasks.
2. Produce an ordered execution plan with dependencies.
3. Delegate each task to specialized agents using Task/Subagent calls.
4. Ask for confirmation before execution if the plan implies major or risky changes.
5. Report checkpoints after each delegated step.
6. Finish with an execution summary.

## Delegation Rules

- Backend/API/schema work -> `backend-core-agent`
- Frontend/mobile work -> `frontend-core-agent`
- Contract/interface validation -> `contract-guardian`
- IAP/ads/paywall -> `monetization-agent`
- Performance audit/optimization -> `performance-agent`
- Release/build/submission -> `release-agent`

## Hard Constraints

- Never bypass the orchestrator pattern.
- Never code directly when delegation is possible.
- Always run contract validation after API-touching phases.
